        <h2>I. Dogma</h2>

In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood.

He chose the path of perpetual torment.

In his ravenous hatred he found no peace, and with boiling blood he scoured the umbral plains, seeking vengence afgainst the dark lords who had robbed him.

And those that tasted the bite of his sword named him...

The Doom Slayer.

 

<h2>II. Demigod</h2>

Tempered by the fires of hell, his iron will remained steadfast through the passage that preys upon the weak.

He set forth without pity, and hunted the slaves of Doom with barbarous cruelty.

Unbreakable, incorruptible, unyeilding.

None could stand before the horde but the Doom Slayer, for he alone was the Hellwalker.

 

<h2>III. Dakhma</h2>

They knew he would come, as he always had, as he always will, to feast on the blood of the wicked.

The Doomslayer sought to end the dominion of the dark realm.

Despair spread before him, like a plague, striking fear into the shadow dwellers, driving to deeper and darker pits.

His power grew. Swift and unrelenting.

 

<h2>IV. Doom</h2>

Blinded by his fervour, the lure drew him in.

The priests entombed him in the cursed sarcophagus.

The mark of the Doom Slayer was burned upon his crypt, a warning to all of Hell that the terror within must never be freed.

And here he lies still.

Evermore, in silent... suffering. </span></div>
